# *The-Final-Project-ODC*
I'm so glad to work with GTCS team (EmanElsayed2002, 7atoom, sarawaleed, norahamed, ahmedwael, Abdulrahman-Alpha) in Software Engineering Hackathon from Orange Digital Center , We were required to create a 2d game using SFML in just 24 hours :).

So, we've created an Ebook and 2d space game in the same programme, i hope you find it usefull.


## here the requirements to use SFML
### on linux just type the following command
```
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```

### on Windows just follow the steps in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcZFaiGFIMA)

if you use codeblocks you need to include the audio file by the following steps. just go to 
project -> build options -> debug -> linker setting , then add the "sfml-audio" file
